//! Unified on-disk + in-memory graph cache shared by `src/deps/` (file-level
//! import graph) and `src/calls/` (symbol-level call graph).
//!
//! One cache file at `.ast-bro/deps/graph.bin`, one fingerprint table,
//! one advisory lock. The deps half is built eagerly on first access; the
//! calls half lives behind `Option<CallGraph>` and only materialises when a
//! `callers`/`callees` query asks for it. Within a process — most importantly
//! `ast-bro mcp` — every consumer reads through `shared::get_or_init`,
//! which holds an `Arc<RwLock<Arc<UnifiedGraph>>>` so multiple tool calls
//! share one in-memory graph and pay the parse cost exactly once per session.
//!
//! Why keep the `deps/` directory name even though it now holds the call
//! graph too: renaming would force every existing user to rebuild from a new
//! path. Schema migrations already force a rebuild, so moving the file would
//! add unnecessary churn.
