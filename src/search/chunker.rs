//! AST-aware code chunking for indexing.
//!
//! Three strategies, picked by file extension:
//!
//! - **Anything ast-grep can parse** (bash, cpp, css, c#, dart, elixir, go,
//!   haskell, hcl, html, java, json, kotlin, lua, nix, php, python, ruby, rust,
//!   scala, solidity, swift, ts/tsx/js, yaml) — split at member boundaries via
//!   ast-grep, descending through type containers to reach them. The chunker
//!   doesn't need a per-language outline adapter; it only needs the AST root +
//!   iteration of named children.
//! - **Markdown** (`.md`/`.markdown`/`.mdx`/`.mdown`) — split at `section`
//!   boundaries via raw `tree_sitter_md`.
//! - **Plain text** (`.toml`, `.zig`, PowerShell `.ps1`/`.psm1`/`.psd1`) —
//!   formats with no tree-sitter grammar in `SupportLang`; split at blank-line
//!   boundaries (LF or CRLF). Files without blank lines become one oversized
//!   chunk, which the packer already tolerates. Note: sources must be UTF-8 —
//!   UTF-16-encoded `.ps1` files fail `read_to_string` and are skipped, like
//!   everywhere else in the codebase.
//!
//! Both paths feed the same greedy packer, which targets `MAX_CHARS = 1500`.
//! Files outside both sets are not chunked — `is_indexable` is the single
//! source of truth for what gets indexed.
//!
//! Output is a hierarchy rather than a partition, described by [`ChunkKind`]:
//! `Source` and `Enclosing` tile the file once, `Part` re-covers the inside of
//! a member too large to stand alone, and `Outline` synthesizes a signature
//! list per file. Only the packer's own regions are size-bounded — a member is
//! never split down the middle to hit the target.
